        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Student at Iowa State University</p>
        <p> Hello, thank you for visiting my webpage! I am Caden Otis, and
            I am currently a junior at Iowa State University. I am majoring in Eletrical Engineering
            and minoring in Computer Science. My area of interest is in Embedded Systems, which is what I'd like
            to pursue a career in.</p>

            <h3>Project 1: Creating a personal portfolio</h3>
            <p>My first project is related to developing a single Web page to create my personal portfolio, where 
                I used HTML and CSS to create my webpage. The project consisted of
                creating a single web page with a menu at the top, known as the
                "Navigation Bar". We also had to include text describing ourself and
                text describing the various projects that we've done. Additionally, we needed to include
                two images: one image is of ourself and a second image of anything
                related to the project itself.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Recreation of the Wordle Game</h3>
            <p>My second project was using the C programming language to recreate the famous Wordle game. The goal was to
                recreate the Wordle game so that it could be played through a text console and to make our own twist
                to the game. With my version of Wordle, there are two difficulties that you can pick from: easy mode or
                hard mode. The easy difficulty is just the regular Wordle game. The hard difficulty is mainly like the
                Wordle game but once you guess the letters of the correct word, then you have to use those letters for
                your next guesses. <br>

                <br>To complete this project, everything that we learned in EE 285 was needed, which was the basics of
                C programming. My role for this project was to set up the prompts that the game tells the player,
                manage how players input guesses, and set up the part of the code that checks if the letters within
                the guessed words are in the correct word and/or if the guessed word is correct overall. By doing
                this project, I learned how to debug code more efficiently and how to code with a group of people. <br>

                <br>By what I learned by completing this project, it will benefit me when I work on the software side of
                embedded systems. The code required for embedded systems is much more detailed and tedious than the
                code used for this project, but doing this project has helped me to navigate code for embedded
                systems.

            <h3>Project 3: Temperature Sensor</h3>
            <p>
                My third project was for a lab in EE 230, where my lab partner and I had the requirements to make a temperature sensor out of
                op-amps, resistors, and LEDs, where certain LEDs would turn on and off depending on what temperature the
                environment was at. <br>

                <br>In order to complete this project, knowledge of comparator, inverting, and non-inverting op-amps was
                needed, as well as basic circuit analysis and circuit wiring skills. My role for this project was to
                build the whole circuit and test voltage and current for different temperatures to make sure our circuit
                worked, while my lab partner created the schematic of our circuit and did the math for what resistor
                values we would need to use. By doing this project, I learned what a comparator op-amp and hysteresis
                are, how to use LTSpice to better analyze circuit behavior, and how crucial it is to test each part of
                the circuit after changes or improvements are made. <br>

                <br>The importance of doing this project is that I now have a better understanding of how op amps can work
                in a circuit, which will be useful when working with electronics that utilize op-amps. This project also
                somewhat simulated a real-life scenario of being given a problem to solve with design constraints, where
                you are left to come up with a working design, so I was given a taste of what I can expect in the
                engineering field.
